This is the GNU TLS library. More up to date information can be found
at http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/ and http://www.gnutls.org/

It is a TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 implementation for the GNU project. 
It is currently under heavy development.

- The library needs libgcrypt. You can find libgcrypt at
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/pub/gcrypt/alpha/libgcrypt/

- Documentation:

****************************
LICENSE ISSUES:

Since the 0.4.2 version the gnutls library is covered under both the 
GNU Lesser GPL, and GNU GPL Licenses. Previously released versions were 
licensed under the GPL. (see COPYING and COPYING.LIB for the licenses)

The LGPL license applies to all parts of the gnutls library except for the 
"OPENPGP authentication" part, and the "SRP authentication" part, which are 
only available under the GPL.  Both of these parts can be disabled at compile 
time.

In order to create a library under the LGPL run the configure script with 
the following parameters:
    --disable-srp-authentication
    --disable-openpgp-authentication

This will disable the above authentication methods. If this is not done 
the library will be only available under the GPL. In both cases the generated
libraries are binary compatible. In the LGPL case the missing functions are 
replaced with stubs that always fail.

The rationale behind this license change is that given the fact that other 
free libraries with similar functionality exist, keeping the gnutls library 
GPL would not give any practical advantage to Free software developers.

Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be licensed 
under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free software projects.
The Lesser GPL is so named because it does less to protect the freedom of 
the users of the code that it covers.  
See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html for more explanation.

BUGS:

Currently gnuTLS needs a lot of testing. By notifying the developers
about a possible bug you may help a lot, since testing is really
important and expensive. If you think you found a bug,
report it to bug-gnutls@gnu.org, together with the needed information,
in order for developers to reproduce it.
