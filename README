This is the GNU TLS library. More up to date information can be found
at http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls and http://www.gnutls.org

It is a TLS implementation for the GNU project. 
It is currently under heavy development. (and still not ready for 
real world programs)

* The library needs libgcrypt. Libgcrypt is part of gnupg (ftp.gnupg.org)

* Documentation:
 view the doc/ directory and the examples in the src/ directory.

BUGS:

Currently gnuTLS needs a lot of testing. By notifying the developers
about a possible bug you may help a lot, since testing is really
important and expensive. If you think you found a bug,
report it to bug-gnutls@gnu.org, together with the needed information,
in order for developers to reproduce it.
