This is the GNUTLS library. It is a TLS implementation under GNU General
Public License. It is currently under heavy development. (and still
not ready for real world programs)

* The library needs libgcrypt. Libgcrypt is part of gnupg (cvs.gnupg.org)

* Run the buildconf script before doing anything. This will create
the needed configure, makefiles etc. using Automake, Autoconf, and libtool.
