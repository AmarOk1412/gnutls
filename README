This is the GNU TLS library. More up to date information can be found
at http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls and http://www.gnutls.org

It is a TLS implementation for the GNU project. 
It is currently under heavy development. (and still not ready for 
real world programs)

* The library needs libgcrypt. Libgcrypt is part of gnupg (ftp.gnupg.org)

* Documentation:
 view the doc/ directory and the examples in the src/ directory.


LICENSE ISSUES:

COPYING.LIB (GNU Lesser GPL) applies to the whole gnutls library
except for the SRP and OPENPGP parts, which are under the GPL.

In order to create a library under the LGPL run the configure script with 
the following parameters:
    --disable-srp-authentication
    --disable-openpgp-authentication

or the library will be under the GPL. In both cases the libraries are
binary compatible. In the LGPL case the functions are replaced with
stubs that always fail.


BUGS:

Currently gnuTLS needs a lot of testing. By notifying the developers
about a possible bug you may help a lot, since testing is really
important and expensive. If you think you found a bug,
report it to bug-gnutls@gnu.org, together with the needed information,
in order for developers to reproduce it.
