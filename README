This is the GNU TLS library.

It is a TLS implementation for the GNU project. 
It is currently under heavy development. (and still not ready for 
real world programs)

* The library needs libgcrypt. Libgcrypt is part of gnupg (cvs.gnupg.org)

* Run the buildconf script before doing anything. This will create
the needed configure, makefiles etc. using Automake, Autoconf, and libtool.
