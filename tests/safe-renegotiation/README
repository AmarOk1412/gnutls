Testing safe renegotiation is relatively complex, here is a summary of
what we test and what how we believe it should work.

srn0.c:

 This tests that the safe renegotiation extension is negotiated
 properly by default on initial connections and on rehandshaked
 connections.  Consequently, it also verifies that rehandshaked
 connections work with the extension enabled.

srn1.c:

 This tests that clients without support for safe renegotiation is
 able to handshake against servers with support, but not able to
 rehandshake (server will refuse rehandshake).

srn2.c:

 This tests that clients with support for safe renegotiation is able
 to handshake against servers without support, but not able to
 rehandshake (client will refuse rehandshake).

srn3.c:

 This tests that a %SAFE_RENEGOTIATION client will reject handshakes
 against servers that do not support the extension (server uses
 %DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION).

srn4.c:

 This tests that a %SAFE_RENEGOTIATION server will reject handshakes
 against clients that do not support the extension.

srn5.c:

 This tests that a client with a permissive policy
 (%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION) is able to handshake and rehandshake with a
 server with no support for the extension.
