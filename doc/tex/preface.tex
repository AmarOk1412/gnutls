\chapter{Preface}

This document tries to demonstrate and explain the \gnutls{} library API.
A brief introduction to the protocols and the technology involved, is
also included. This is also important for a \tls{} application programmer
to know, because security and cryptographic protocols are involved. 
Those require the programmer
to make correct use of these protocols, or risks to offer a false feeling
of security, on an unsecured application.

Although this document tries to be self contained, basic 
network programming and PKI knowlegde is assumed in most of this document. 
\cite{GUTPKI} is a good introduction to Public Key Infrastructure.
