\chapter{Preface}

This document tries to demonstrate the \gnutls{} library API, the
protocols and the technology involved. I believe that a basic
understanding of the underlying protocols is important, before
using \tls{}. This is because security and cryptographic
protocols are involved, which require the application programmer
to make correct use of these protocols, or no security is
offered. Although this document tries to be self contained, basic 
network programming and PKI knowlegde is assumed in most of this document. 
I suggest \cite{GUTPKI} for an introduction to Public Key Infrastructure.
