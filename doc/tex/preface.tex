\chapter*{Preface}

\section*{Introduction}
This document tries to demonstrate and explain the \gnutls{} library API.
A brief introduction to the protocols and the technology involved, is
also included. That way a \tls{} application programmer can better understand
the \gnutls{} purpose and actual offerings. 
Even if \gnutls{} is a typical library software, it operates over several
security and cryptographic protocols, which require the programmer
to make careful and correct usage of them. Otherwise he risks to offer
just a false sense of security. Also note that a program should not be
considered secure just because it uses \gnutls{} or any other cryptographic library.
There are several ways to compromise a program or a communication line
and \gnutls{} only helps with some of them. 
\par
This document tries to be self contained, although basic 
network programming and PKI knowlegde is assumed in most of it. 
\cite{GUTPKI} is a good introduction to Public Key Infrastructure.
