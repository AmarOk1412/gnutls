\section{Client examples}
This section contains examples of \tls{} and \ssl{} clients, using \gnutls{}. 

\subsection{Simple client example with X.509 certificate support}
Let's assume now that we want to create a client which communicates
with servers using the X509 authentication schema. The following client
is a very simple \tls{} client, it does not support session resuming nor
any other fancy features.

\subsection{Getting peer's information}
\par The above example was the simplest form of a client, it didn't even check
the result of the peer's certificate verification function (ie. if we have
an authenticated connection). The following function does check the peer's X509
Certificate, and prints some information about the current state.
\par
This function should be called after a successful

\subsection{Simple client example with SRP authentication}
Although {\bf SRP} is not part of the \tls{} standard, \gnutls{} implements
{\it David Taylor's} proposal\footnote{This is work in progress.}  for using the SRP algorithm
within the \tls{} handshake protocol. The following client
is a very simple SRP-TLS client which connects to a server 
and authenticates using {\it username} and {\it password}.

\section{Server examples}
This section contains examples of \tls{} and \ssl{} servers, using \gnutls{}.

\subsection{Echo Server with X.509 and SRP authentication}
The following example is a server which supports both {\bf SRP} and {\bf X509} authentication.
This server also supports {\it session resuming}.
