\section{Client examples}
This section contains examples of \tls{} and \ssl{} clients, using \gnutls{}. 

\subsection{Simple client example with X.509 certificate support}
Let's assume now that we want to create a client which communicates
with servers using the X.509 authentication schema. The following client
is a very simple \tls{} client, it does not support session resuming nor
any other fancy features.
\input{ex2}

\subsection{Getting peer's information}
\par The above example was the simplest form of a client, it didn't even check
the result of the peer's certificate verification function. The lack of
this check may result to an unauthenticated connection.
The following function does check the peer's
X.509 certificate, and prints some information about the current session.
\par
This function should be called after a successful
\printfunc{gnutls_handshake}{gnutls\_handshake}

\input{ex3}

\subsection{Client with Resume capability example}
\label{resume-example}
This is the same client as above, but here we add support for session
resumption.
\input{ex4}

\subsection{Client with Resume capability example II}
\label{resume-example2}
This is also a client with resume capability, but also demonstrates
the use of session IDs.
\input{ex1}

\subsection{Simple client example with SRP authentication}
Although {\bf SRP} is not part of the \tls{} standard, \gnutls{} implements
{\it David Taylor's} proposal\footnote{This is work in progress.}  for using the SRP algorithm
within the \tls{} handshake protocol. The following client
is a very simple SRP-TLS client which connects to a server 
and authenticates using {\it username} and {\it password}.

\input{srp1}

\section{Server examples}
This section contains examples of \tls{} and \ssl{} servers, using \gnutls{}.

\subsection{Echo Server with X.509 and SRP authentication}
The following example is a server which supports both {\bf SRP} and {\bf X.509} authentication.
This server also supports {\it session resuming}.
