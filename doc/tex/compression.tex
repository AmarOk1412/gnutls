\subsection{Compression algorithms used in the record layer}
\index{Compression algorithms}
The TLS' record layer also supports compression. The algorithms
implemented in \gnutls{} can found in figure \ref{fig:compression}.
All the algorithms should be considered as \gnutls' extensions, and
should be advertised only when the peer is known to have a compliant client,
to avoid interoperability problems.
\par
The included algorithms perform really good when text, or other
compressable data are to be transfered, but offer nothing on already 
compressed data, such as compressed images, zipped archives etc.
These compression algorithms, may be useful in high bandwidth TLS tunnels,
and in cases where network usage has to be minimized. As a drawback, 
compression increases latency.

available if the \gnutlse{} library has been initialized.
