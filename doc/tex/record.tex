\section{The TLS record protocol\index{Record protocol}}

The Record protocol is the secure communications provider. It's job is
to encrypt and authenticate packets. 
The following functions are available:
\par
\begin{itemize}
\item \printfunc{gnutls_record_send}{gnutls\_record\_send}:
to send an record packet (with application data).
\item \printfunc{gnutls_record_recv}{gnutls\_record\_recv}:
to receive a record packet (with application data).
\end{itemize}

As you may have already noticed, the functions which access the Record protocol,
are quite limited, given the importance of this protocol in \tls{}.
This is because the Record protocol's parameters are all set by
the Handshake protocol (see section \ref{handshake} on page \pageref{handshake}).
\par
The Record protocol initialy starts with NULL parameters, which means
no encryption, and no MAC is used. Encryption and authentication begin
just after the handshake protocol has finished.
