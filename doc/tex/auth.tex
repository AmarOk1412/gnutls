\section{Authentication methods}
\par
The following authentication schemas are supported in \gnutls:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item X509 Public Key Infrastructure
 \item Anonymous authentication
 \item SRP authentication
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Authentication using X.509 certificates}
If using this kind of authentication then the key exchange methods
shown in \hyperref{figure}{figure }{}{fig:x509} are
available to use. Authentication in this method is performed using signed
certificates by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Note that \gnutls is
not a generic purpose X.509 toolkit\footnote{Aegypten is such a toolkit. See http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/}. 
It does only include the required,
in order to use the TLS ciphersuites which require X.509 certificates.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{9cm}|}
\hline
X509PKI\_RSA & The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and send it to the peer.
The certificate must allow the key to be used for encryption.
\\
\hline
X509PKI\_DHE\_RSA & The RSA algorithm is used to sign Ephemeral Diffie Hellman
parameters which are send to the peer. The key in the certificate must allow
the key to be used for signing 
\\
\hline
X509PKI\_DHE\_DSS & The DSS\footnote{DSS stands for Digital Signature Standard} algorithm is used to sign Ephemeral Diffie Hellman
parameters which are send to the peer. Currently \gnutls does not support this ciphersuite.
\\

\subsection{Anonymous authentication}
The anonymous key exchanges perform encryption but there is no indication of the 
identity of the peer. This kind of authentication is vulnerable to man in the middle attack, 
but this protocol can be used even if there is no prior communication or common trusted
parties with the peer. Unless really required, do not use anonymous authentication.
Available key exchange methods are shown in \hyperref{figure}{figure }{}{fig:anon}.

ANON\_DH & This algorithm exchanges Diffie Hellman parameters.

\subsection{Authentication using SRP}
Authentication using the SRP\footnote{SRP stands for Secure Password Protocol and 
is described in RFC2945. The SRP key exchange is not a part of the \tlsI protocol}
is actually password authentication, since the two peers are identified by the knowledge of a password. 
This protocol also offers protection against off-line attacks (password file stealing etc). 
This is achieved since SRP does not use the plain password to perform authentication, but something called a 
verifier. The verifier is $g^{x}mod(n)$ and $x$ is a value calculated
from the username and the password. 
\par SRP is normaly used with a SHA based hash function, to calculate
the value of $x$. In \gnutls in addition to original SHA hash function,
a hash function based on blowfish crypt is also supported. The blowfish
crypt function has the property of variable complexity, thus the
verifier may resist future attacks based on computational power, by just increasing
the complexity of the function (sometimes called 'the cost').
\par The advantage of SRP authentication, over other proposed secure password 
authentication schemas, is that SRP does not require the server to hold
the user's password. This kind of protection is similar to the one used traditionaly
in the \emph{UNIX} 'passwd' file, where the contents of this file did not cause
harm to the system security if they were revealed.
