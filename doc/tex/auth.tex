\chapter{Authentication methods}

The \tls{} protocol provides confidentiality and encryption, but
also offers authentication, which is a prerequisite
for a secure connection. 
The available authentication methods in \gnutls{} are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Certificate authentication
 \item Anonymous authentication
 \item SRP authentication
\end{enumerate}

\section{Anonymous authentication\index{Anonymous authentication}}
The anonymous key exchange perform encryption but there is no indication of 
the identity of the peer. This kind of authentication is vulnerable to a
man in the middle attack, 
but this protocol can be used even if there is no prior communication and
trusted parties with the peer, or when full anonymity is required.
Unless really required, do not use anonymous authentication.
Available key exchange methods are shown in \hyperref{figure}{figure }{}{fig:anon}.
\par
Note that the key exchange methods for anonymous authentication
require Diffie Hellman parameters to be generated and associated with an
anonymous credentials structure.
