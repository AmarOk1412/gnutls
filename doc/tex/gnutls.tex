\section{Introduction}
\par
gnuTLS is a library which implements the {\bf TLS 1.0} and {\bf SSL 3.0} protocols.
TLS stands for 'Transport Layer Security' and is the sucessor of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
{\bf TLS 1.0} is described is {\it RFC 2246} and is an Internet protocol (thus it's mostly used over TCP/IP),
that provides confidentiality, and authentication layers. Currently {\bf gnuTLS} implements:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the {\bf TLS 1.0} and {\bf{ SSL 3.0}} protocols, without any (US) export-controlled algorithms
 \item {\bf X509} Public Key Infrastructure (with several limitations).
 \item {\bf SRP} for TLS authentication.
 \item {\bf TLS Extensions}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Confidentiality}
\par
Confidentiality is provided by using symmetric encryption algorithms like {\bf 3DES}, {\bf AES}, or
stream algorithms like {\bf ARCFOUR}. A symmetric encryption algorithm uses a single (secret) key
to encrypt and decrypt data.

\subsection{Authentication}
\par
The following authentication schemas are supported in gnuTLS:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item X509 Public Key Infrastructure
 \item Anonymous authentication
 \item SRP authentication
\end{enumerate}



\section{Client Examples}
This section contains examples of TLS and SSL clients, using gnuTLS. 

\subsection{Simple Client example with X509 Authentication}
Let's assume now that we want to create a client which communicates
with servers using the X509 authentication schema. The following client
is a very simple TLS client, it does not support session resuming nor
any other fancy features.
\input{ex2}

\subsection{Getting peer's information}
\par The above example was the simplest form of a client, it didn't even check
the result of the peer's certificate verification function (ie. if we have
an authenticated connection). The following function does check the peer's X509
Certificate, and prints some information about the current state.
\par
This function should be called after a successful gnutls\_handshake().

\input{ex3}

\subsection{Resuming Sessions}
\par
The gnutls\_handshake() function, is expensive since
a lot of calculations are performed. In order to support many fast connections to
the same server a client may use session resuming. {\bf Session resuming} is a
feature of the {\bf TLS} protocol which allows a client to connect to a server,
after a successful handshake, without the expensive calculations (ie. use the previously
established keys). {\bf gnuTLS} supports this feature, and this example illustrates a
typical use of it (This is a modification of the simple client example).

\par
Keep in mind that sessions are expired after some time (for security reasons), thus
it may be normal for a server not to resume a session even if you requested that.

\subsection{Simple Client example with SRP Authentication}
Although {\bf SRP} is not part of the TLS standard, gnuTLS implements
{\it draft-ietf-tls-srp-01} which defines a way to use the SRP algorithm
within the TLS handshake. The following client
is a very simple SRP-TLS client which connects to a server by using 
{\it username} and {\it password}.

\input{srp1}

\section{Server Examples}
This section contains examples of TLS and SSL servers, using gnuTLS.

\subsection{Echo Server with X509 and SRP authentication}
The following example is a server which supports both {\bf SRP} and {\bf X509} authentication.
This server also supports {\it session resuming}.
