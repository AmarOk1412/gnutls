\section{Introduction}
\par
gnuTLS is a library which implements the {\bf TLS 1.0} and {\bf SSL 3.0} protocols.
TLS stands for 'Transport Layer Security' and is the sucessor of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
{\bf TLS 1.0} is described is {\it RFC 2246} and is an Internet protocol (thus it's mostly used over TCP/IP),
that provides confidentiality, and authentication layers. 

\subsection{Confidentiality}
\par
Confidentiality is provided by using symmetric encryption algorithms like {\bf 3DES}, {\bf AES}, or
stream algorithms like {\bf ARCFOUR}. A symmetric encryption algorithm uses a single (secret) key
to encrypt and decrypt data.

\subsection{Authentication}
\par
The following authentication schemas are supported in gnuTLS:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item X509 Public Key Infrastructure
 \item Anonymous authentication
 \item SRP authentication
\end{enumerate}



\section{X509 Client Examples}

Let's assume now that we want to create a client which communicates
with servers using the X509 authentication schema. The following client
is a very simple TLS client, it does not support session resuming nor
any other fancy features.

\subsection{Simple Client example}

\subsection{Getting peer's information}
\par The above example was the simplest form of a client, it didn't even check
the result of the peer's certificate verification function (ie. if we have
an authenticated connection. The following function does check the peer's X509
Certificate, and prints some information about the current state.
\par
This function should be called after a successful \begin{verbatim}gnutls_handshake()\end{verbatim}.

\subsection{Resuming Sessions}
\par
The \begin{verbatim}gnutls_handshake()\end{verbatim} function, is expensive since
a lot of calculations are performed. In order to support many fast connections to
the same server a client may use session resuming. {\bf Session resuming} is a
feature of the {\bf TLS} protocol which allows a client to connect to a server,
after a successful handshake, without the expensive calculations (ie. use the previously
established keys). {\bf gnuTLS} supports this feature, and this example illustrates a
typical use of it. (This is a modification of the simple client example)

\par
Keep in mind that sessions are expired after some time (for security reasons), thus
it may be normal for a server not to resume a session even if you requested that.
