\chapter{Introduction to \tls{}}

\label{sec:tlsintro}
\tls{} stands for 'Transport Layer Security' and is the successor of \ssl{},
the Secure Sockets Layer protocol\footnote{described in \cite{SSL3}} designed by Netscape. 
\tlsI{} is an Internet protocol,
defined by {IETF}\footnote{IETF or Internet Engineering Task Force 
is a large open international community of network
designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of 
the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet. It is open 
to any interested individual.}, described in \cite{RFC2246} and
also in \cite{RESCOLA}. The protocol provides confidentiality, and 
authentication layers over any reliable transport layer. The description, 
below, refers to \tlsI{} but also applies to \sslIII{} since the differences 
of these protocols are minor. Older protocols such as \sslII{} are not 
discussed nor implemented in \gnutls{} since they are not considered secure 
today.
