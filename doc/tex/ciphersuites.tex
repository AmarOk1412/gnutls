\section{TLS Cipher suites}
\par 
The Handshake Protocol of \tlsI{} negotiates ciphersuites 
like the {\bf TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_CBC\_SHA}.
These ciphersuites contain three parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item The key exchange algorithm (DHE\_RSA in the example)
\item The Symmetric encryption algorithm and mode (3DES\_CBC in this
example)
\item The MAC\footnote{MAC stands for Message Authentication Code. It can
be described as a keyed hash algorithm. See RFC2104.} algorithm used for authentication.
MAC\_SHA is used in the above example.
\end{itemize}

The ciphersuite negotiated in the handshake protocol, will affect 
the Record Protocol, by enabling encryption and data authentication.
Note that \tlsI does not always
negotiate the strongest available cipher suite. There are cases where
a man in the middle attacker could make the two entities negotiate
the least secure method they support. For that reason do not enable
ciphers and algorithms that you consider weak.
