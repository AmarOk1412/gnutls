\subsection{TLS cipher suites}
\par 
The Handshake Protocol of \tlsI{} negotiates cipher suites 
of the form \\
{\bf TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_CBC\_SHA}.
The usual cipher suites contain these parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item The key exchange algorithm ---DHE\_RSA in the example.
\item The Symmetric encryption algorithm and mode ---3DES\_CBC in this
example.
\item The MAC\footnote{MAC stands for Message Authentication Code. It can
be described as a keyed hash algorithm. See RFC2104.} algorithm used for authentication.
MAC\_SHA is used in the above example.
\end{itemize}

The ciphersuite negotiated in the handshake protocol, will affect 
the Record Protocol, by enabling encryption and data authentication.
Note that you should not overrely on \tls{} to negotiate the strongest 
available cipher suite. Do not enable
ciphers and algorithms that you consider weak.
