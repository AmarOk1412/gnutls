\subsection{Symmetric encryption algorithms}
\par
Confidentiality is provided by using block encryption algorithms like {\bf 3DES}, 
{\bf AES\footnote{AES or Advanced Encryption Standard is actually the RIJNDAEL algorithm. This is the
algorithm that will replace DES.}}, or
stream algorithms like {\bf ARCFOUR\footnote{ARCFOUR is a compatible
algorithm with RSA's RC4 algorithm.}} See \hyperref{fig:ciphers}{figure }{}{fig:ciphers} for a complete list. 
Ciphers are encryption algorithms that use a single (secret) key
to encrypt and decrypt data. Block algorithms in TLS also provide protection
against statistical analysis of the data. \gnutls{} makes use of this property
thus, if you're operating in \tlsI{} mode, a random number of blocks will be
appended to the data. This will prevent eavesdroppers from guessing the 
actual data size.

\hline
3DES\_CBC & 3DES\_CBC is the DES block cipher algorithm used with multiple (triple)
encryption (EDE). Has 64 bits block size and is used in CBC mode.
\\
\hline
ARCFOUR & ARCFOUR is a fast stream cipher.
\\
\hline
AES\_CBC & AES or RIJNDAEL is the block cipher algorithm that replaces the old 
(and insecure\footnote{due to small key length}) DES algorithm. Has
128 bits block size and is used in CBC mode. This is not officially
supported in TLS.
\\
\hline
TWOFISH\_CBC & TWOFISH is a block cipher algorithm by Counterpane. Has
128 bits block size and is used in CBC mode. This algorithm is not
part of TLS. It is a \gnutls{} extension.
