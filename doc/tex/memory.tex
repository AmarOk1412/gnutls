\section{Memory handling}

\gnutls{} internally handles heap allocated objects differently, depending
on the sensitivity of the data they contain. However for performance
reasons, the default memory functions do not overwrite sensitive data from
memory, nor protect such objects from being written to the swap. 
In order to change the default behavior the
\printfunc{gnutls_global_set_mem_functions}{gnutls\_global\_set\_mem\_functions}
function is available which can be used to set other memory 
handlers than the defaults. 
\par
The \emph{libgcrypt} library on which \gnutls{} depends, has such secure
memory allocation functions available. These should be used in cases
where even the system's swap memory is not considered secure. See
the documentation of \emph{libgcrypt} for more information.
