\label{sec:pgp}

This authentication method is part of the certificate authentication
method in \gnutls{}. All the key exchange methods shown in \hyperref{figure}{figure }{}{fig:cert} are
available in OpenPGP authentication. The \gnutls{}'s implementation is based on the
paper \cite{TLSPGP}.

See \ref{pgp:trust} on page \pageref{pgp:trust} for more information 
about the OpenPGP trust model.
