\section{Compatibility with the OpenSSL\index{OpenSSL} library}

To ease \gnutls{}' integration with existing applications, a compatibility 
layer with the widely used OpenSSL library is included in the \emph{gnutls-extra}
library. This compatibility layer is not complete and it is not 
intended to completely reimplement the OpenSSL API with \gnutls{}.

Prototypes for the compatibility functions are found in the 
``gnutls/openssl.h'' header file.
