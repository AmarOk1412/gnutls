\section{Compatibility with the OpenSSL\index{OpenSSL} library}

To ease \gnutls{}' integration with existing applications, a compatibility 
layer with the widely used OpenSSL library is included in the \emph{gnutls-openssl}
library. This compatibility layer is not complete and it is not 
intended to completely reimplement the OpenSSL API with \gnutls{}.
It only provides source-level compatibility. There is currently no
attempt to make it binary-compatible with OpenSSL.

Prototypes for the compatibility functions are found in the 
``gnutls/openssl.h'' header file.

Current limitations imposed by the compatibility layer include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Error handling is not thread safe.

\end{itemize}
