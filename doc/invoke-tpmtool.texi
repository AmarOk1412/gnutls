@end example
@exampleindent 4

@anchor{tpmtool bits}
@subsubheading bits option

This is the ``specify the number of bits for key generate'' option.


@anchor{tpmtool debug}
@subsubheading debug option (-d)

This is the ``enable debugging.'' option.
Specifies the debug level.

@anchor{tpmtool delete}
@subsubheading delete option

This is the ``delete the key identified by the given url (uuid).'' option.


@anchor{tpmtool generate-rsa}
@subsubheading generate-rsa option

This is the ``generate an rsa private-public key pair'' option.
Generates an RSA private-public key pair in the TPM chip. 
The key may be stored in filesystem and protected by a PIN, or stored (registered)
in the TPM chip flash.

@anchor{tpmtool inder}
@subsubheading inder option

This is the ``use the der format for keys.'' option.
The input files will be assumed to be in the portable
DER format of TPM. The default format is a custom format used by various
TPM tools

@anchor{tpmtool infile}
@subsubheading infile option

This is the ``input file'' option.


@anchor{tpmtool legacy}
@subsubheading legacy option

This is the ``any generated key will be a legacy key'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must appear in combination with the following options:
generate-rsa.
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
signing.
@end itemize



@anchor{tpmtool list}
@subsubheading list option

This is the ``lists all stored keys in the tpm'' option.


@anchor{tpmtool outder}
@subsubheading outder option

This is the ``use der format for output keys'' option.
The output will be in the TPM portable DER format.

@anchor{tpmtool outfile}
@subsubheading outfile option

This is the ``output file'' option.


@anchor{tpmtool pubkey}
@subsubheading pubkey option

This is the ``prints the public key of the provided key'' option.


@anchor{tpmtool register}
@subsubheading register option

This is the ``any generated key will be registered in the tpm'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must appear in combination with the following options:
generate-rsa.
@end itemize



@anchor{tpmtool sec-param}
@subsubheading sec-param option

This is the ``specify the security level [low, legacy, normal, high, ultra].'' option.
This is alternative to the bits option. Note however that the
values allowed by the TPM chip are quantized and given values may be rounded up.

@anchor{tpmtool signing}
@subsubheading signing option

This is the ``any generated key will be a signing key'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must appear in combination with the following options:
generate-rsa.
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
legacy.
@end itemize



@anchor{tpmtool system}
@subsubheading system option

This is the ``any registred key will be a system key'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must appear in combination with the following options:
register.
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
user.
@end itemize

The generated key will be stored in system persistent storage.

@anchor{tpmtool user}
@subsubheading user option

This is the ``any registered key will be a user key'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must appear in combination with the following options:
register.
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
system.
@end itemize

The generated key will be stored in a user specific persistent storage.

@anchor{tpmtool exit status}
@subsubheading tpmtool exit status

One of the following exit values will be returned:
@table @samp
@item 0
Successful program execution.
@item 1
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
@end table
