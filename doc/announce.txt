Subject: GnuTLS 2.10.1 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
We are proud to announce a new stable GnuTLS release: Version 2.10.1.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implements the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.  GnuTLS is developed for GNU/Linux, but works on many
Unix-like systems and comes with a binary installer for Windows.

The GnuTLS library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License version 2.1 (or later).  The "extra" GnuTLS
library (which contains TLS/IA support, LZO compression and Libgcrypt
FIPS-mode handler), the OpenSSL compatibility library, the self tests
and the command line tools are all distributed under the GNU General
Public License version 3.0 (or later).  The manual is distributed
under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3 (or later).

The project page of the library is available at:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/

What's New
==========

** libgnutls: Added support for broken certificates that indicate RSA
with strange OIDs.

** gnutls-cli: Allow verification using V1 CAs.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_privkey_import() will fallback to
gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8() without a password, if it
is unable to decode the key.

** libgnutls: Correctly deinitialize crypto API functions to prevent
a memory leak. Reported by Mads Kiilerich.

certtool: If asked to generate DSA keys of size more than 1024 bits,
issue a warning, that the output key might not be working everywhere.

certtool: The --pkcs-cipher is taken into account when generating a
private key. The default cipher used now is aes-128. The old behavior can
be simulated by specifying "--pkcs-cipher 3des-pkcs12".

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Getting the Software
====================

GnuTLS may be downloaded from one of the mirror sites or direct from
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/>.  The list of mirrors can be found at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/download.html>.

Here are the BZIP2 compressed sources (7.2MB):

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.1.tar.bz2
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.1.tar.bz2

Here are OpenPGP detached signatures signed using key 0xB565716F:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.1.tar.bz2.sig
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.1.tar.bz2.sig

Note, that we don't distribute gzip compressed tarballs.

In order to check that the version of GnuTLS which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you should verify the OpenPGP
signature.  You can use the command

     gpg --verify gnutls-2.10.1.tar.bz2.sig

This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made by
that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key, either by
checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources or by checking
that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other key.  The signing
key can be identified with the following information:

pub   1280R/B565716F 2002-05-05 [expires: 2011-03-30]
      Key fingerprint = 0424 D4EE 81A0 E3D1 19C6  F835 EDA2 1E94 B565 716F
uid                  Simon Josefsson <jas@extundo.com>
uid                  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>
sub   1280R/4D5D40AE 2002-05-05 [expires: 2011-03-30]

The key is available from:
  http://josefsson.org/key.txt
  dns:b565716f.josefsson.org?TYPE=CERT

Alternatively, after successfully verifying the OpenPGP signature of
this announcement, you could verify that the files match the following
checksum values.  The values are for SHA-1 and SHA-224 respectively:

Support
=======

Improving GnuTLS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GnuTLS useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money
or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GnuTLS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GnuTLS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.

Happy Hacking,
Simon
