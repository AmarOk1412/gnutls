Subject: GnuTLS 2.10.4 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
We are proud to announce a new stable GnuTLS release: Version 2.10.4.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implements the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.  GnuTLS is developed for GNU/Linux, but works on many
Unix-like systems and comes with a binary installer for Windows.

The GnuTLS library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License version 2.1 (or later).  The "extra" GnuTLS
library (which contains TLS/IA support, LZO compression and Libgcrypt
FIPS-mode handler), the OpenSSL compatibility library, the self tests
and the command line tools are all distributed under the GNU General
Public License version 3.0 (or later).  The manual is distributed
under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3 (or later).

The project page of the library is available at:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/

What's New
==========

** gnutls-serv: Corrected a buffer overflow. Reported and patch by Tomas Mraz.

** libgnutls: Use ASN1_NULL when writing parameters for RSA signatures. 
This makes us comply with RFC3279. Reported by Michael Rommel.

** libgnutls: Reverted default behavior for verification and
introduced GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT. Thus by default
V1 trusted CAs are allowed, unless the new flag is specified.

** minitasn1: Updated to Libtasn1 2.9.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Getting the Software
====================

GnuTLS may be downloaded from one of the mirror sites or direct from
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/>.  The list of mirrors can be found at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/download.html>.

Here are the BZIP2 compressed sources (7.0MB):

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.4.tar.bz2
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.4.tar.bz2

Here are OpenPGP detached signatures signed using key 0xB565716F:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.4.tar.bz2.sig
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.10.4.tar.bz2.sig

Note, that we don't distribute gzip compressed tarballs.

In order to check that the version of GnuTLS which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you should verify the OpenPGP
signature.  You can use the command

     gpg --verify gnutls-2.10.4.tar.bz2.sig

This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made by
that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key, either by
checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources or by checking
that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other key.  The signing
key can be identified with the following information:

pub   1280R/B565716F 2002-05-05 [expires: 2011-03-30]
      Key fingerprint = 0424 D4EE 81A0 E3D1 19C6  F835 EDA2 1E94 B565 716F
uid                  Simon Josefsson <jas@extundo.com>
uid                  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>
sub   1280R/4D5D40AE 2002-05-05 [expires: 2011-03-30]

The key is available from:
  http://josefsson.org/key.txt
  dns:b565716f.josefsson.org?TYPE=CERT

Alternatively, after successfully verifying the OpenPGP signature of
this announcement, you could verify that the files match the following
checksum values.  The values are for SHA-1 and SHA-224 respectively:

f0dcd7b68748b48d7b945c52b6a9e64d643e4b58  gnutls-2.10.4.tar.bz2

Internationalization
====================

The GnuTLS library messages have been translated into Czech, Dutch,
French, German, Italian, Malay, Polish, Simplified Chinese, Swedish,
and Vietnamese.  We welcome the addition of more translations.

Support
=======

Improving GnuTLS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GnuTLS useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money
or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GnuTLS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GnuTLS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.

Happy Hacking,
Simon
