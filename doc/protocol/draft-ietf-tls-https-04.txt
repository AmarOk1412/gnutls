This memo describes how to use TLS to secure HTTP connections over
the Internet. Current practice is to layer HTTP over SSL (the
predecessor to TLS), distinguishing secured traffic from insecure
traffic by the use of a different server port. This document documents
that practice using TLS. A companion document describes a method for
using HTTP/TLS over the same port as normal HTTP [RFC2817].

This document is a product of the Transport Layer Security Working
Group of the IETF.
