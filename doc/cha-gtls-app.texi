@node Preparation
@section Preparation

To use @acronym{GnuTLS}, you have to perform some changes to your
sources and your build system. The necessary changes are explained in
the following subsections.

@menu
* Headers::
* Initialization::
* Version check::
* Building the source::
@end menu

@node Headers
@subsection Headers

All the data types and functions of the @acronym{GnuTLS} library are
defined in the header file @file{gnutls/gnutls.h}.  This must be
included in all programs that make use of the @acronym{GnuTLS}
library.

The extra functionality of the @acronym{GnuTLS-extra} library is
available by including the header file @file{gnutls/extra.h} in your
programs.

@node Initialization
@subsection Initialization

GnuTLS must be initialized before it can be used.  The library is
initialized by calling @funcref{gnutls_global_init}.  The resources
allocated by the initialization process can be released if the
application no longer has a need to call GnuTLS functions, this is
done by calling @funcref{gnutls_global_deinit}.

The extra functionality of the @acronym{GnuTLS-extra} library is
available after calling @funcref{gnutls_global_init_extra}.

In order to take advantage of the internationalization features in
GnuTLS, such as translated error messages, the application must set
the current locale using @code{setlocale} before initializing GnuTLS.

@node Version check
@subsection Version check

It is often desirable to check that the version of `gnutls' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary
compatibility new features may have been introduced but due to problem
with the dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may
want to check that the version is okay right after program start-up.
See the function @funcref{gnutls_check_version}.

@node Building the source
@subsection Building the source

If you want to compile a source file including the
@file{gnutls/gnutls.h} header file, you must make sure that the
compiler can find it in the directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished
by adding the path to the directory in which the header file is
located to the compilers include file search path (via the @option{-I}
option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, the library uses the
external package @command{pkg-config} that knows the path to the
include file and other configuration options.  The options that need
to be added to the compiler invocation at compile time are output by
the @option{--cflags} option to @command{pkg-config gnutls}.  The
following example shows how it can be used at the command line:

@smallexample
gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags`
@end smallexample

Adding the output of @samp{pkg-config gnutls --cflags} to the
compilers command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
@file{gnutls/gnutls.h} header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the @option{-L} option).  For this, the option
@option{--libs} to @command{pkg-config gnutls} can be used.  For
convenience, this option also outputs all other options that are
required to link the program with the library (for instance, the
@samp{-ltasn1} option).  The example shows how to link @file{foo.o}
with the library to a program @command{foo}.

@smallexample
gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config gnutls --libs`
@end smallexample

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to @command{pkg-config}:

@smallexample
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags --libs`
@end smallexample

@node TLS and DTLS sessions
@section TLS and DTLS sessions
@subsection Session initialization

In the previous sections we have discussed the global initialization
required for GnuTLS as well as the initialization required for each
authentication method's credentials (see @ref{Authentication methods}).
In this section we elaborate on the TLS or DTLS session initiation.
Each session is initialized using @funcref{gnutls_init} which among
others is used to specify the type of the connection (server or client), 
and the underlying protocol type, i.e., datagram (UDP) or reliable (TCP).

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_init}

After the session initialization details on the allowed ciphersuites
and protocol versions should be set using the priority functions
such as @funcref{gnutls_priority_set_direct}. We elaborate on them
in @ref{Priority Strings}.
The credentials used for the key exchange method, such as certificates 
or usernames and passwords should also be associated with the session
current session using @funcref{gnutls_credentials_set} (see @ref{Authentication methods}). 

The next step is to setup the underlying transport layer details. The
Berkeley sockets for TCP are implicitly used by default in GnuTLS, thus a
call to @funcref{gnutls_transport_set_ptr2} would be sufficient to
specify the socket descriptor.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_transport_set_ptr2}

@showfuncA{gnutls_transport_set_ptr}

If however another transport layer than TCP is selected, then
the following functions have to be specified.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_transport_set_push_function}
@showfuncdesc{gnutls_transport_set_vec_push_function}
@showfuncdesc{gnutls_transport_set_pull_function}

In the case of DTLS it is also desirable to override the
functions above with functions that emulate the operation
of @code{recvfrom} and @code{sendto}. In addition
the following function must also be called to specify a 
callback that will receive data from within a specified
time limit.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function}

@subsection Handshake
Once a session has been initialized and a network
connection has been set up, TLS and DTLS protocols
perform a handshake. The handshake is the actual key
exchange.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_handshake}

The handshake process doesn't ensure the verification
of the peer's identity. When certificates are in use,
this can be done, either after the handshake is complete, or during 
the handshake if @funcref{gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function}
has been used. In both cases the following function can be
used to verify the peer's certificate (see @ref{Certificate authentication}
for more information).

@showfuncA{gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2}


@subsection Data transfer and termination
Once the handshake is complete and peer's identity
has been verified data can be exchanged. The available
functions resemble the POSIX @code{recv} and @code{send}
functions.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_record_send}
@showfuncdesc{gnutls_record_recv}

In DTLS it is adviceable to use the extended receive
function shown below, because it allows the extraction
of the sequence number. This is required in DTLS because
messages may arrive out of order.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_record_recv_seq}

A helper function is available to check whether data
to be read are pending in a @acronym{GnuTLS} session.
This is the equivalent in POSIX systems to using @code{select} 
for data waiting to be read by @code{recv}.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_record_check_pending}

Once a TLS or DTLS session is no longer needed, it is
recommended to use @funcref{gnutls_bye} to terminate the
session. That way the peer is notified securely about the
intention of termination, which allows distinguishing it
from a malicious connection termination.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_bye}

A session can be deinitialized using the following function.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_deinit}

@subsection DTLS sessions

Because datagram TLS can operate over connections where the peer
of a server cannot be reliably verified, functionality is available to prevent
denial of server attacks. @acronym{GnuTLS} requires a server
to generate a secret key that is used to sign a cookie@footnote{A key of 128 bits or 16 bytes should be sufficient for this purpose.}. 
That cookie is sent to the client using @funcref{gnutls_dtls_cookie_send}, and 
the client must reply using the correct cookie. The server side
should verify the initial message sent by client using @funcref{gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify},
if successful associate a session with the cookie using @funcref{gnutls_dtls_prestate_set}
and proceed to a proper handshake.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_key_generate}

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_dtls_cookie_send}

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify}

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_dtls_prestate_set}


Note that the above apply to server side only. The client side cookie handling
is part of @funcref{gnutls_handshake}. However both client and server
side should set the correct maximum transfer unit for
the layer underneath @acronym{GnuTLS}. This would allow proper fragmentation
of DTLS messages.

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_dtls_set_mtu}

@node Priority Strings
@section Priority strings

In order to specify cipher suite preferences on client or server side, the
previously mentioned priority functions accept a string
that specifies the enabled for the handshake algorithms.
That string may contain some high level keyword such as
the keywords in @ref{tab:prio-keywords}
or it might contain special keywords, to be explained
later on.

@showfuncD{gnutls_priority_set_direct,gnutls_priority_init,gnutls_priority_deinit,gnutls_priority_set}

Unless the first keyword is "NONE" the defaults (in preference
order) are for TLS protocols TLS 1.2, TLS1.1, TLS1.0, SSL3.0; for
compression NULL; for certificate types X.509, OpenPGP.
For key exchange algorithms when in NORMAL or SECURE levels the
perfect forward secrecy algorithms take precedence of the other
protocols.  In all cases all the supported key exchange algorithms
 are enabled (except for the RSA-EXPORT which is only enabled in
EXPORT level).

The NONE keyword must followed by the algorithms to be enabled,
and is used to provide the exact list of requested algorithms@footnote{To avoid collisions in order to specify a compression algorithm in
this string you have to prefix it with "COMP-", protocol versions
with "VERS-", signature algorithms with "SIGN-" and certificate types with "CTYPE-". All other
algorithms don't need a prefix.}. The order with which every algorithm
is specified is significant. Similar algorithms specified before others
will take precedence. The individual algorithms are shown in @ref{tab:prio-algorithms}

@node Simple client example with anonymous authentication
@subsection Simple client example with anonymous authentication

The simplest client using TLS is the one that doesn't do any
authentication.  This means no external certificates or passwords are
needed to set up the connection.  As could be expected, the connection
is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (active or redirection) attacks.
However, the data is integrity and privacy protected.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client1.c

@node Simple client example with X.509 certificate support
@subsection Simple client example with @acronym{X.509} certificate support

Let's assume now that we want to create a TCP client which
communicates with servers that use @acronym{X.509} or
@acronym{OpenPGP} certificate authentication. The following client is
a very simple @acronym{TLS} client, it does not support session
resuming, not even certificate verification. The TCP functions defined
in this example are used in most of the other examples below, without
redefining them.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client2.c

@node Simple Datagram TLS client example
@subsection Simple datagram @acronym{TLS} client example

This is a client that uses @acronym{UDP} to connect to a
server. This is the @acronym{DTLS} equivalent to 
@ref{Simple client example with X.509 certificate support} above.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-udp.c

@node Obtaining session information
@subsection Obtaining session information

Most of the times it is desirable to know the security properties of
the current established session.  This includes the underlying ciphers
and the protocols involved.  That is the purpose of the following
function.  Note that this function will print meaningful values only
if called after a successful @funcref{gnutls_handshake}.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-session-info.c

@node Verifying peer's certificate
@subsection Verifying peer's certificate
@anchor{ex:verify}

A @acronym{TLS} session is not secure just after the handshake
procedure has finished.  It must be considered secure, only after the
peer's certificate and identity have been verified. That is, you have
to verify the signature in peer's certificate, the hostname in the
certificate, and expiration dates.  Just after this step you should
treat the connection as being a secure one.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-rfc2818.c

@node Using a callback to select the certificate to use
@subsection Using a callback to select the certificate to use

There are cases where a client holds several certificate and key
pairs, and may not want to load all of them in the credentials
structure.  The following example demonstrates the use of the
certificate selection callback.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-cert-select.c

@node Verifying a certificate
@subsection Verifying a certificate

An example is listed below which uses the high level verification
functions to verify a given certificate list.

@subsection Using a @acronym{PKCS} #11 token with TLS

This example will demonstrate how to load keys and certificates
from a @acronym{PKCS} #11 token, and use it with a TLS connection.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-cert-select-pkcs11.c


@node Client with Resume capability example
@subsection Client with resume capability example
@anchor{ex:resume-client}

This is a modification of the simple client example. Here we
demonstrate the use of session resumption. The client tries to connect
once using @acronym{TLS}, close the connection and then try to
establish a new connection using the previously negotiated data.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-resume.c


@node Simple client example with SRP authentication
@subsection Simple client example with @acronym{SRP} authentication

The following client is a very simple @acronym{SRP} @acronym{TLS}
client which connects to a server and authenticates using a
@emph{username} and a @emph{password}. The server may authenticate
itself using a certificate, and in that case it has to be verified.

@node Parameter generation
@subsection Parameter generation
@cindex parameter generation
@cindex generating parameters

Several TLS ciphersuites require additional parameters that
need to be generated or provided by the application. The
Diffie-Hellman based ciphersuites (ANON-DH or DHE), require
the group information to be provided. This information can be either
be generated on the fly using @funcref{gnutls_dh_params_generate2}
or imported from some pregenerated value using @funcref{gnutls_dh_params_import_pkcs3}.
The parameters can be used in a session by calling
@funcref{gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params} or
@funcref{gnutls_anon_set_server_dh_params} for anonymous sessions.

@showfuncD{gnutls_dh_params_generate2,gnutls_dh_params_import_pkcs3,gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params,gnutls_anon_set_server_dh_params}

Due to the time-consuming calculations required for the generation
of Diffie-Hellman parameters we suggest against performing generation
of them within an application. The @code{certtool} tool can be used to 
generate or export known safe values that can be stored in code
or in a configuration file to provide the ability to replace. We also
recommend the usage of @funcref{gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits} (see @ref{Selecting cryptographic key sizes}) to determine
the bit size of the parameters to be generated.

The ciphersuites that involve the RSA-EXPORT key exchange require
additional parameters. Those ciphersuites are rarely used today
because they are by design insecure, thus if you have no requirement
for them, this section should be skipped. The RSA-EXPORT key exchange
requires 512-bit RSA keys to be generated. It is recommended those
parameters to be refreshed (regenerated) in short intervals. The
following functions can be used for these parameters.

@showfuncD{gnutls_rsa_params_generate2,gnutls_certificate_set_rsa_export_params,gnutls_rsa_params_import_pkcs1,gnutls_rsa_params_export_pkcs1}

To allow renewal of the parameters within an application without
accessing the credentials, which are a shared structure,
an alternative interface is available using a callback function.  

@showfuncdesc{gnutls_certificate_set_params_function}


@node Keying Material Exporters
@subsection Keying material exporters
@cindex keying material exporters
@cindex exporting keying material

The TLS PRF can be used by other protocols to derive data.  The API to
use is @funcref{gnutls_prf}.  The function needs to be provided with the
label in the parameter @code{label}, and the extra data to mix in the
@code{extra} parameter.  Depending on whether you want to mix in the
client or server random data first, you can set the
@code{server_random_first} parameter.

For example, after establishing a TLS session using
@funcref{gnutls_handshake}, you can invoke the TLS PRF with this call:

@smallexample
#define MYLABEL "EXPORTER-FOO"
#define MYCONTEXT "some context data"
char out[32];
rc = gnutls_prf (session, strlen (MYLABEL), MYLABEL, 0,
                 strlen (MYCONTEXT), MYCONTEXT, 32, out);
@end smallexample

If you don't want to mix in the client/server random, there is a more
low-level TLS PRF interface called @funcref{gnutls_prf_raw}.

@node Channel Bindings
@subsection Channel bindings
@cindex channel bindings

In user authentication protocols (e.g., EAP or SASL mechanisms) it is
useful to have a unique string that identifies the secure channel that
is used, to bind together the user authentication with the secure
channel.  This can protect against man-in-the-middle attacks in some
situations.  That unique string is called a ``channel binding''.  For
background and discussion see @xcite{RFC5056}.

In @acronym{GnuTLS} you can extract a channel binding using the
@funcref{gnutls_session_channel_binding} function.  Currently only the
type @code{GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE} is supported, which corresponds to
the @code{tls-unique} channel binding for TLS defined in
@xcite{RFC5929}.

The following example describes how to print the channel binding data.
Note that it must be run after a successful TLS handshake.

@smallexample
@{
  gnutls_datum_t cb;
  int rc;

  rc = gnutls_session_channel_binding (session,
                                       GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE,
                                       &cb);
  if (rc)
    fprintf (stderr, "Channel binding error: %s\n",
             gnutls_strerror (rc));
  else
    @{
      size_t i;
      printf ("- Channel binding 'tls-unique': ");
      for (i = 0; i < cb.size; i++)
        printf ("%02x", cb.data[i]);
      printf ("\n");
    @}
@}
@end smallexample

@node Compatibility with the OpenSSL library
@subsection Compatibility with the OpenSSL library
@cindex OpenSSL

To ease @acronym{GnuTLS}' integration with existing applications, a
compatibility layer with the OpenSSL library is included
in the @code{gnutls-openssl} library. This compatibility layer is not
complete and it is not intended to completely re-implement the OpenSSL
API with @acronym{GnuTLS}.  It only provides limited source-level
compatibility. 

The prototypes for the compatibility functions are in the
@file{gnutls/openssl.h} header file. The limitations 
imposed by the compatibility layer include:

@itemize

@item Error handling is not thread safe.

@end itemize

@node Using the cryptographic library
@section Using the cryptographic library

@acronym{GnuTLS} is not a low-level cryptographic library, i.e., 
it does not provide access to basic cryptographic primitives. However
it abstracts the internal cryptographic back-end (see @ref{Cryptographic Backend}),
providing symmetric crypto, hash and HMAC algorithms, as well access
to the random number generation.

@node Symmetric cryptography
@subsection Symmetric cryptography
@cindex symmetric cryptography

The available functions to access symmetric crypto algorithms operations
are shown below. The supported algorithms are the algorithms required by the TLS protocol.
They are listed in @ref{tab:ciphers}.

@node Hash and HMAC functions
@subsection Hash and HMAC functions
@cindex hash functions
@cindex HMAC functions

The available operations to access hash functions and hash-MAC (HMAC) algorithms
are shown below. HMAC algorithms provided keyed hash functionality. They supported HMAC algorithms are listed in @ref{tab:macs}.

@showfuncF{gnutls_hmac_init,gnutls_hmac,gnutls_hmac_output,gnutls_hmac_deinit,gnutls_hmac_get_len,gnutls_hmac_fast}

The available functions to access hash functions are shown below. The supported hash functions
are the same as the HMAC algorithms.
