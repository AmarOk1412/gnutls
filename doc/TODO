If you want to contribute (implement something from the current list, or
anything), contact the developer's mailing list (gnutls-dev@lists.gnupg.org),
in order to avoid having people working on the same thing. 

Current list:
* Add a callback function in certificate authentication, to receive
  the certificate and the private key. This might require a rewrite
  of the certificate selection part.
* Add gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key() and gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring()
  functions, similar to gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key().
* Add gnutls_openpgp_key_get_key_usage().
* Use subkeys with the 0x20 flag in openpgp keys (if present),
  instead of the main key.
* Add support for generating and handling DSA keys
* Add support for extracting CRL distribution points.
* Add support for generating CRLs.
* Convert documentation to texinfo format
* Audit the code
* Allow sending V2 Hello messages. It seems that some (old) broken 
  implementations require that.
* Allow unexpected Client Hello messages
* Add Kerberos support

(+) Means high priority 
(*) Means medium priority
(-) Means low priority (ie. nobody is interested to develop that)
