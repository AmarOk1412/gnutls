* x509 Certificate API
* OpenPGP certificate support (through libgcrypt)
* Make server work (we need certificate API for that!)
* Add support for v2.0 init packet (why do that anyway ???)
* Resume old sessions (server side)
* Non-blocking IO support (send mail to gnutls-dev@gnupg.org if you are interested/want to help)
