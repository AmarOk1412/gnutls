If you want to contribute (implement something from the current list, or
anything), contact the developer's mailing list (gnutls-dev@lists.gnupg.org),
in order to avoid having people working on the same thing. 

Current list:
+ Add DHE_RSA ciphersuite
* Add function to update the fixed Diffie Hellman primes
* Audit the code (volunteers?)
* Add support for PKCS8 encrypted private keys
* Add support for PKCS12
* Add support for certificates with DSS parameters
* Add function to return the certificate verification path
* Add TLS more extensions
* Design a Private/Public key database
* Tools for processing/generating certificates
* OpenPGP certificate support (through libgcrypt)
- Add Kerberos support

(+) Means high priority 
(*) Means medium priority
(-) Means low priority (ie. nobody is interested to develop that)
