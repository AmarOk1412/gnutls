If you want to contribute (implement something from the current list, or
anything), contact the developer's mailing list (gnutls-dev@lists.gnupg.org),
in order to avoid having people working on the same thing. 

Current list:
* Add ability to read PKCS-12 structures (certificate and private key)
* Convert documentation to texinfo format
* Audit the code
* Allow sending V2 Hello messages. It seems that some broken 
  implementations require that.
* Add GPGSM certificate manager support
* Allow unexpected Client Hello messages
* Add Kerberos support

(+) Means high priority 
(*) Means medium priority
(-) Means low priority (ie. nobody is interested to develop that)
