If you want to contribute (implement something from the current list, or
anything), contact the developer's mailing list (gnutls-dev@lists.gnupg.org),
in order to avoid having people working on the same thing. 

Current list for the stable 1.0.x branch:
* Bugfixes only

(+) Means high priority 
(*) Means medium priority
(-) Means low priority (ie. nobody is interested to develop that)
