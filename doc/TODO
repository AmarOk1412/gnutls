* x509 Certificate API ( Fabio.Fiorina@alcatel.it is currently working on an ASN.1 parser)
* OpenPGP certificate support (through libgcrypt)
* Add Kerberos support (who wants that?)
* Audit the code (volunteers?)
* Fix renegotiate
* Add certificate verification in order for clients to work
* Optimize X509PKI_SERVER_CREDENTIALS so that there should be
  only one parse of the der structures.
