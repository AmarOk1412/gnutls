If you want to use the gnutls library in other projects
using autoconf/aclocal, put in your 

aclocal.m4:
 include(libgnutls.m4)

configure.in:
 AM_PATH_LIBGNUTLS( 0.3.90,, AC_MSG_ERROR([[
***
*** libgnutls was not found. You may want to get it from
*** ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/pub/gnutls/
]]))


these macros define LIBGNUTLS_LIBS and LIBGNUTLS_CFLAGS.
