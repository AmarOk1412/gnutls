Some additional information regarding some of the algorithms:

@table @code
@item RSA
RSA is public key cryptosystem designed by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir
and Leonard Adleman.  It can be used with any hash functions.

@item DSA
DSA is the USA's Digital Signature Standard.  It may use the SHA
family of hash algorithms.

@item ECDSA
ECDSA is the elliptic curve counter-part of DSA. 

@item MD2
MD2 is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by Ron Rivest.  It is
optimized for 8-bit processors.  Outputs 128 bits of data.  There are
several known weaknesses of this algorithm and it should not be used.

@item MD5
MD5 is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by Ron Rivest. Outputs
128 bits of data.  It is considered to be broken.

@item SHA-1
SHA is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by NSA. Outputs 160
bits of data.  It is also considered to be broken, though no practical
attacks have been found.

@item RMD160
RIPEMD is a cryptographic hash algorithm developed in the framework of
the EU project RIPE.  Outputs 160 bits of data.
