We are proud to announce a new stable GnuTLS release: Version 2.8.6.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implements the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.  GnuTLS is developed for GNU/Linux, but works on many
Unix-like systems and comes with a binary installer for Windows.

The GnuTLS library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License version 2.1 (or later).  The "extra" GnuTLS
library (which contains TLS/IA support, LZO compression and Libgcrypt
FIPS-mode handler), the OpenSSL compatibility library, the self tests
and the command line tools are all distributed under the GNU General
Public License version 3.0 (or later).  The manual is distributed under
the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3 (or later).

The project page of the library is available at:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/

What's New
==========

** libgnutls: For CSRs, don't null pad integers for RSA/DSA value.
VeriSign rejected CSRs with this padding.  Reported by Wilankar Trupti
<trupti.wilankar@hp.com> and Boyan Kasarov <bkasarov@gmail.com>.

Note: As a side effect of this change, the "public key identifier"
value computed for a certificate using this version of GnuTLS will be
different from values computed using earlier versions of GnuTLS.

** libgnutls: For CSRs on DSA keys, don't add DSA parameters to the
** optional SignatureAlgorithm parameter field.
VeriSign rejected these CSRs.  They are stricly speaking not needed
since you need the signer's certificate to verify the certificate
signature anyway.  Reported by Wilankar Trupti
<trupti.wilankar@hp.com> and Boyan Kasarov <bkasarov@gmail.com>.

** libgnutls: When checking openpgp self signature also check the signatures
** of all subkeys.
Ilari Liusvaara noticed and reported the issue and provided test
vectors as well.

** libgnutls: Cleanups and several bug fixes.
Found by Steve Grubb and Tomas Mraz.

** Link libgcrypt explicitly to certtool, gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv.

** Fix --disable-valgrind-tests.
Reported by Ingmar Vanhassel in
<https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?107029>.

** examples: Use the new APIs for printing X.509 certificate information.

** Fix build failures on Solaris.
Thanks to Dagobert Michelsen <dam@opencsw.org>.

** i18n: Updated Czech, Dutch, French, Polish, Swedish and Vietnamese
** translations.  Added Simplified Chinese translation.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Getting the Software
====================

GnuTLS may be downloaded from one of the mirror sites or direct from
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/>.  The list of mirrors can be found at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/download.html>.

Here are the BZIP2 compressed sources (6.2MB):

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.8.6.tar.bz2
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.8.6.tar.bz2

Here are OpenPGP detached signatures signed using key 0xB565716F:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.8.6.tar.bz2.sig
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnutls/gnutls-2.8.6.tar.bz2.sig

Note, that we don't distribute gzip compressed tarballs.

In order to check that the version of GnuTLS which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you should verify the OpenPGP
signature.  You can use the command

     gpg --verify gnutls-2.8.6.tar.bz2.sig

This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made by
that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key, either by
checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources or by checking
that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other key.  The signing
key can be identified with the following information:

pub   1280R/B565716F 2002-05-05 [expires: 2011-03-30]
      Key fingerprint = 0424 D4EE 81A0 E3D1 19C6  F835 EDA2 1E94 B565 716F
uid                  Simon Josefsson <jas@extundo.com>
uid                  Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>
sub   1280R/4D5D40AE 2002-05-05 [expires: 2011-03-30]

The key is available from:
  http://josefsson.org/key.txt
  dns:b565716f.josefsson.org?TYPE=CERT

Alternatively, after successfully verifying the OpenPGP signature of
this announcement, you could verify that the files match the following
checksum values.  The values are for SHA-1 and SHA-224 respectively:

bff911d4fd7389aa6698a644b3748eb2d23715bc  gnutls-2.8.6.tar.bz2

Documentation
=============

The manual is available online at:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/documentation.html

In particular the following formats are available:

 HTML: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/index.html
 PDF: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/gnutls.pdf

For developers there is a GnuTLS API reference manual formatted using
the GTK-DOC tools:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/reference/gnutls-gnutls.html

For developers interested in improving code quality, we publish
Cyclomatic code complexity charts that help you find code that may need
review and improvements:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/cyclo/

Also useful are code coverage charts which indicate parts of the source
code that needs to be tested better by the included self-tests:

addition of more translations.

Support
=======

Improving GnuTLS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GnuTLS useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money
or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GnuTLS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GnuTLS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.

Happy Hacking,
Simon
